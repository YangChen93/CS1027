# CS1027
This repo is for people who wish to see my coding style and quality. I took CS 1027: Java Fundamentals II in Sep 2020 at Western University. It contains exact coding files and Javadoc for all 10 labs and 4 assignmnets.
 
## Assignment Description:

## **Assignment 1**

Designed algorithm for a one-person version of Battleship game. Creating classes with simple methods by basic arrays and multi-dimensional arrays

> - Ship.java
> - Board.java
> - Game.java

**Grade Received: 100%**
 
## **Assignment 2**

For this assignment, I designed algorithms for a candy collection game to find as many candies as possiable. Implemented using stacks and handelling exceptions.
